# Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Thank you for showing an interest in Stats - Health, Fitness Widget. I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. Therefore, the app is built to keep your data completely private.

## Your Privacy
I (James Shaw) built Stats - Health, Fitness Widget (also termed "the Service", "our Service", or "this Service") as a free app. The app is currently provided at no cost at the point of download and is intended for use as is.

This part of the support website is used to inform users about the service's policies on the manner in which the service accesses, uses, stores, or shares user data ("Personal Information").

If you choose to use Stats - Health, Fitness Widget, then you agree to the request and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that the service requests is used for providing and improving the app. The service will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
Stats - Health, Fitness Widget **does not** collect or store any personally identifiable information.

## Apple HealthKit Data
Stats - Health, Fitness Widget requests your permission to read your Apple Health data for use in the app. This data **does not** leave your device. The data read from Apple Health is used solely for visualising your data within the app. It is not collected or disclosed outside of your local installation of the app.

Apple HealthKit is an activity data handling service provided by Apple Inc that enables you to access or store activity data. [Apple Health Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

## Premium Purchases
If you sign-up for Premium access, either via Subscription or In-App Purchase, your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the Apple App Store and are not visible to me. I will simply get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription/in-app purchase, the term you signed up for and when it is due to expire. This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa).

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new or updated Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
